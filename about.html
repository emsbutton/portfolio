    <p>I'm a website designer and front-end developer currently based in Brookhaven, GA.
I began as a self-taught coder and graphic designer, and spent several years being "The Grad Student Who Can Code" or "The Intern Who Knows Photoshop" before working as a developer full-time.</p>
<p>I've always had a good eye for color and a good brain for puzzles, and I enjoy combining the two to create beautiful, thoughtful, functional websites.</p>
<p>Because I developed my skills on the job in non-profit organizations, I also gained firsthand experience with many of the other disciplines that influence an organization's web strategy: Marketing, Public Relations, Fund Development, Event Coordination / Community Outreach, and even Accounting.</p>
<p>Creating a meaningful conversation between these organizational stakeholders and the users they're trying to reach is my most important job as a designer.</p>
