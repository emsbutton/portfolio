    <p>While planning for the rebranding of the Texas A&M Health Science Center to simply Texas A&M Health, my team was asked to conceptualize a website that would tie together all of the university’s clinical care endeavors under the new brand.</p> 
        
    <p>We were initially given no content and very little direction—only that the site should allow for future clinics and resemble “a cousin” of the Health Science Center redesign.</p>

        <p>After researching peer patient care and health network websites, we brainstormed a list of basic site features (contact information, locations map, provider bios, patient portal, etc). I used these ideas to build a bare-bones site structure, and created page prototypes with limited brand colors and stock photography. Slowly we were able to replace the stock photography with our own clinical images. We sat on these initial designs until the administration was ready to move forward.</p>
        
        <p>Once the clinical sites were identified and rebranded, I was able to add in actual contact information and provider details. I also added some integrations with our health news website and newsletter.</p>
        
        <p>The site launched with only two clinic locations, but continues to grow as the Texas A&M Health brand expands.</p>
