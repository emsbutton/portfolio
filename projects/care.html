    <p>This website, like the Patient Care arm of Texas A&M Health itself, took many different forms before its current state, and continues to evolve. Given only a name and a deadline, my team was asked to conceptualize a website that would tie together all of the universityâ€™s clinical care endeavors under the new brand.</p>
    <p>We had several broad concepts but very little in the way of actual content. The design needed to resemble the streamlined cousin of the Health Science Center website: attractive, straightforward and functional with a focus on patient needs.</p>
    <p>To achieve these goals and attempt to leave room for future growth and change, I chose to reduce the number of fonts and visual design elements. I put provider search and contact information front and center, and chose images that focus on positive patient-provider interactions. As Texas A&M Health continues to add clinic locations and patient resources, the site will be ready to expand to meet these demands.
