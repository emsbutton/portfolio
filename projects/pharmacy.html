    <p>After the successful launch of the <a href="/portfolio/projects/health.html">newly-redesigned Health Science Center website</a>, my team immediately shifted to adapt the new design to each of the five health college websites.</p> 
    <p>I was tasked with creating a new set of components and pages that reflected the aesthetic of the new Health Science Center site, while also meeting the unique needs of each college.</p>
    <p>Here I’m presenting the College of Pharmacy’s redesign as a representation of my process.</p>

      <p>My biggest challenge to adapting the new design was the sheer volume and depth of the content. While the Health Science Center site structure was quite shallow, the internal “nitty gritty” pages on the college sites needed to handle content that was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>imed at a more segmented audience</li>
      <li>More detailed and interconnected</li>
      <li>More likely to be accessed directly by a web search than by a user beginning at the home page and navigating through the site</li>
    </ul>
      <p>I wanted my internal page designs to clean and legible, use headings and lists for skimming, and be logically interconnected when appropriate. I also wanted to cut down on content levels to improve discoverability and SEO.</p>
      
      <p>I began with a content audit, working with Pharmacy staff members to remove outdated content, combine similar content, eliminate redundancies, and fill in any gaps. </p>
      
      <p>While experimenting with the site hierarchy and navigation, I developed a tabbed page layout that could merge a folder of short individual pages into one tabbed page. Grouping these tabbed pages into sections produced custom local sidebar navigation. Adding links ensured that users had multiple pathsways through the site, regardless of where they entered.</p>
  
      <p>The last pieces of the puzzle were the college’s top-level landing pages, or “story pages”. My marketing colleagues and the Pharmacy administration worked together to identify and promote the college’s unique strengths and priorities.  Once we knew the story we wanted to tell, I repackaged many of the interactive components from the Health Science Center design to bring it to life.</p>
