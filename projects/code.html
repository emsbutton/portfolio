    <p>Texas A&M Patient Care is the clinical care component of Texas A&M Health.</p>
    <p>This project, like the clinical care concept itself, has taken many different forms and continues to evolve. Given only a name and a deadline, my team was asked to conceptualize a website that would tie together all of the universityâ€™s clinical care endeavors under a new brand: Texas A&M Health. However, we wouldn't know until much later which clinics would be involved in the rebranding initiative.</p>
    <p>We had several broad concepts to start with, but very little in the way of actual content. The design needed to resemble the streamlined cousin of the Health Science Center website: attractive, straightforward, and functional, with a focus on patient needs.</p>
    <p>To achieve the desired look and attempt to leave room for future growth, I drastically reduced the number of fonts, colors, and visual design elements in the flagship design. I put provider search and contact information front and center, and chose images showing positive patient-provider interactions. As Texas A&M Health continues to add clinic locations and patient resources, the site will be ready to expand to meet these demands.
