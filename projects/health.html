    <p>In 2017, the Texas A&M Health Science Center website was suffering from an identity crisis. The answers to fundamental questions—What is the HSC? How is it related to the university? Who is this content for, and why should they care?—were lost amid the subtle links and garish calls to action.</p>
    <p>Though we approached the site from different angles, the marketing, web, and print staff had clear goals for a redesign. We all wanted a smaller, more modern site, a clear voice for a single audience, and a visually cohesive brand presence across all media.</p>

        <p>To accomplish our goals, we chose to start from scratch, combining our in-house web and communications talent to serve the role of an agency. We focused solely on content for external audiences, we divorced the site structure from the organizational chart, and we streamlined our design process and development environment.</p>
        
      <p>My role in this project was to coordinate all the moving parts:</p>
        <ul class="copy-list">
        <li>I collaborated with our designers to adapt our brand’s print look and feel into an overall design aesthetic, then created modular web components for different use cases throughout the site.</li>
        <li>I coached our copywriters on writing for the web, and used real content for mockups so that the text and visual aspects of the design continually informed each other.</li>
        <li>As we began to develop the actual site structure, I analyzed past user behavior and set up testing opportunities, letting the data inform our information architecture and navigation.</li>
        <li>Once the building blocks and site structure were in place, I delegated migration and finishing tasks to other team members.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While no design project is free from challenges and compromises, ultimately my team was successful in elevating a website with an identity crisis to serve as a functional, modern marketing tool.</p>
