    <p>In 20??, the Texas A&M Health Science Center website was suffering from an identity crisis. Answers to the fundamental questions—What is the HSC? How is it related to the university? Who is this content for, and why should they care?—were lost in a sea of too-subtle links and too-garish calls to action.</p>

      <p>As we began to seriously discuss a site redesign, the marketing, web, and print staff all approached these problems from slightly different angles. We all wanted a smaller, more modern site with a clear audience, and we wanted to unify our brand presence with print and other media. Our mantra emerged early in the planning process: Tell one story.</p>

        <p>To that end, we chose to combine our in-house web and communications talent to serve as an agency for our institutional partners. We also decided to start from scratch, focusing solely on content for external audiences, divorcing the site structure from the center’s org chart, and updating the development environment.</p>
        
      <p>My role in this project was to coordinate all the moving parts. I worked with our designers to adapt our brand’s print look and feel into an overall design aesthetic, then created modular web components built in a modern framework. I worked with our copywriters to incorporate real content into my mockups, so that the text and visual aspects of the design continually informed each other. As we began to develop the actual site structure, I analyzed past user behavior and set up testing opportunities, letting the data inform our information architecture and navigation choices.
