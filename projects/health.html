    <p>The Texas A&M Health Science Center is made up of five colleges and numerous education, research and outreach centers and institutes across Texas.</p>
      <p>The organization’s geographically diverse model allows for endless impact opportunities throughout the state, but also creates challenges in identity, coordination and messaging.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the flagship website was a visual manifestation of these challenges.</p>

        <p>Redesigning the site called for not only a complete overhaul of the website’s outdated look, but a reconception of the organization’s purpose and vision. Our aim was simple: Tell one cohesive story.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this goal, we chose to start from scratch, combining our in-house web and communications talent to serve as a consulting agency. We focused solely on content for external audiences, we divorced the site structure from the organizational chart, and we streamlined our design process and development environment.</p>

        <p>While no design project is free from challenges and compromises, ultimately my team was successful in elevating a website with an identity crisis to serve as a functional, modern marketing tool.</p>
