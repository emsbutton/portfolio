    <p>In 2017, the Texas A&M Health Science Center website was suffering from an identity crisis. Answers to fundamental questions—What is the HSC? How is it related to the university? Who is this content for, and why should they care?—were lost amid the subtle links and garish calls to action.</p>
    <p>Though we approached the site's problems from different angles, the marketing, web, and print staff had clear goals for a redesign. We all wanted a smaller, more modern site with a clear audience that visually matched our brand presence across other media.</p>

        <p>To accomplish these goals, we chose to combine our in-house web and communications talent to serve as an agency for our institutional partners. We also decided to start from scratch. We focused solely on content for external audiences, we divorced the site structure from the center’s org chart, and we streamlined our design process and development environment.</p>
        
      <p>My role in this project was to coordinate all the moving parts. I worked with our designers to adapt our brand’s print look and feel into an overall design aesthetic, then created modular web components built in a modern framework. I worked with our copywriters to incorporate real content into my mockups, so that the text and visual aspects of the design continually informed each other. As we began to develop the actual site structure, I analyzed past user behavior and set up testing opportunities, letting the data inform our information architecture and navigation choices.
